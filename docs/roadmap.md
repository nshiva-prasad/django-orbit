# Roadmap: Agent-Native Debugging

Django Orbit should evolve from a Django debugging dashboard into an agent-native observability layer: a local, privacy-conscious system that gives humans and AI agents enough structured context to move from ticket or error to root-cause hypothesis and proposed fix.

## Direction

The future debugging workflow is likely to be hybrid:

- humans use the dashboard for inspection, trust-building and quick triage;
- agents use MCP tools, incident bundles and structured traces for investigation;
- coding agents consume the same context to propose patches, tests and pull requests;
- OpenTelemetry compatibility keeps Orbit interoperable with the wider observability ecosystem.

Orbit's differentiator should be Django-native context: request lifecycle, ORM behavior, middleware, templates, cache, storage, mail, auth/gates, jobs, signals and settings-aware safety boundaries.

## Track A: High-Level MCP Tools

Current MCP tools expose useful raw slices. The next generation should expose investigation primitives that answer developer and agent questions directly.

### Request and Endpoint Investigation

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `investigate_request(family_hash)` | Return a complete diagnosis for one request: request summary, child events, slow spans, duplicate queries, exceptions, logs and likely causes. |
| `investigate_endpoint(path, method=None, hours=24)` | Summarize health for an endpoint across recent traffic: latency, error rate, slow queries, top exception groups and regressions. |

## Track B: Incident Bundles

Incident Bundles are portable evidence packages generated from a request, exception group, endpoint, ticket text or natural-language query. They should be small enough for agents, structured enough for automation and readable enough for humans.

### Bundle Sources

- `family_hash` for a single request lifecycle;
- exception `fingerprint` for grouped errors;
- endpoint path/method for route-level behavior;
- raw ticket text or pasted traceback;
- tag, query or time window.

### Bundle Contents

Each bundle should include:

- metadata: bundle id, generated at, Orbit version, time window, source type;
- primary evidence: request summary, exception summary, endpoint stats or matched ticket terms;
- timeline: ordered events with relative offsets;
- query analysis: slow queries, duplicate signatures, callsites and EXPLAIN summaries when available;
- logs: warning/error logs near the event, grouped by logger/message shape;
- related systems: cache, jobs, mail, storage, Redis, HTTP client, gates;
- safety report: masking status, omitted fields, payload truncation and MCP exposure policy;
- hypotheses: ranked causes with supporting evidence and confidence;
- suggested next actions: reproduce, inspect file/surface, add test, check config, add index, etc.;
- agent handoff: compact JSON plus Markdown brief.

### Bundle Formats

- `incident_bundle.json` for agents and automation;
- `incident_bundle.md` for tickets, PRs and humans;
- optional zipped export for sharing with maintainers;
- future: OTLP trace export for OpenTelemetry-compatible backends.

### MCP Tools for Bundles

- `create_incident_bundle(source_type, source_id_or_text, hours=72)`
- `get_incident_bundle(bundle_id)`
- `list_recent_incident_bundles(limit=20)`
- `export_incident_bundle(bundle_id, format="json|markdown")`
- `redact_incident_bundle(bundle_id, policy="agent_safe")`

### Storage Model

Start without a new table: generate bundles on demand from `OrbitEntry` and return them directly. Add persisted bundles later only if users need sharing, comments or issue tracking.

## Track C: OpenTelemetry Bridge

Add OpenTelemetry as an interoperability lane, not as a replacement for Orbit's Django-native storage.

Possible milestones:

1. `orbit.exporters.opentelemetry` module that converts `OrbitEntry` objects into OTEL-like spans/events.
2. Config keys: `OTEL_EXPORT_ENABLED`, `OTEL_EXPORT_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, `OTEL_HEADERS`, `OTEL_SAMPLE_RATE`.
3. Map `family_hash` to `trace_id` and child entries to spans/events.
4. Map SQL/cache/http_client/job/mail/storage events to semantic attributes where stable.
5. Add GenAI/LLM attributes when the AI watcher ships.
6. Provide `python manage.py orbit_export_otel --since ...` for batch export.
7. Optional live export hook with strict fail-silent behavior.

## Track D: AI and LLM Watcher

Capture AI application behavior for Django apps that call LLM providers or agent frameworks.

Initial surfaces:

- OpenAI Python SDK;
- Anthropic Python SDK;
- LangChain / LangGraph callbacks;
- LiteLLM if present;
- HTTP fallback for known provider hosts.

Events should capture only safe metadata by default:

- provider, model, operation, status;
- latency, retries, timeout/error type;
- token counts and estimated cost when available;
- tool call names, not raw arguments by default;
- prompt/completion capture disabled by default and guarded by explicit config;
- request family correlation so LLM calls appear inside the Django request timeline.

Possible config:

```python
ORBIT_CONFIG = {
    "RECORD_AI": True,
    "AI_CAPTURE_PROMPTS": False,
    "AI_CAPTURE_COMPLETIONS": False,
    "AI_CAPTURE_TOOL_ARGS": False,
    "AI_MASK_KEYS": ["password", "token", "secret"],
}
```

## Track E: Agent Safety Layer

Before Orbit becomes deeply agentic, it needs explicit data boundaries.

Milestones:

1. Central `agent_safe_serialize_entry(entry)` used by MCP and bundles.
2. Default field allowlists by entry type.
3. Payload size caps and deterministic truncation metadata.
4. MCP-level config: `MCP_ENABLED`, `MCP_ALLOWED_TOOLS`, `MCP_DENIED_TOOLS`, `MCP_MAX_LIMIT`, `MCP_INCLUDE_PAYLOADS`.
5. `audit_mcp_exposure()` tool.
6. Masking preview in dashboard and MCP.
7. Optional per-environment profiles: `local`, `staging`, `production`.

## Track F: From Error to Fix Hypothesis

Orbit should not directly edit code. It should produce evidence-rich handoffs that coding agents can use.

Workflow:

1. Developer pastes a ticket, traceback or endpoint complaint.
2. Orbit matches it to entries, exception groups, endpoints or related logs.
3. Orbit creates an Incident Bundle.
4. Orbit ranks hypotheses and suggests repro/test plan.
5. A coding agent consumes the bundle, inspects the repo, writes tests, proposes a fix and references the evidence.
6. Orbit can later verify whether the runtime symptom disappeared.

MCP sequence example:

```text
investigate_ticket("Users get 500 on checkout")
create_incident_bundle("ticket", "Users get 500 on checkout")
propose_fix_hypotheses(bundle_id)
propose_test_plan(bundle_id)
generate_pr_context(bundle_id)
```

## Near-Term Priority

The pragmatic next PR sequence:

1. Add `agent_safe_serialize_entry()` and make existing MCP tools use it.
2. Add `investigate_request(family_hash)`.
3. Add `investigate_exception_group(fingerprint)`.
4. Add `create_incident_bundle(...)` as on-demand JSON.
5. Add `build_debug_brief(query, hours=72)`.
6. Add OpenTelemetry export design doc and config stub.
7. Add AI watcher behind conservative defaults.
